    "Ans: An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It signals that there is something wrong with the code and prevents the program from continuing to run until the issue is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are mistakes in the syntax of the code that prevent the code from being executed correctly. Syntax errors occur when the code doesn't follow the correct structure or format required by the Python programming language, such as a missing parenthesis, a misspelled keyword, or an incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions are raised at runtime, while syntax errors are caught by the Python interpreter before the code is executed. Syntax errors prevent the code from being executed, while exceptions allow the code to be executed but interrupt its normal flow. Additionally, exceptions can be handled and resolved within the code, while syntax errors must be fixed in the code itself before it can be executed."
